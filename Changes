	- original version; created by h2xs 1.16
	- implements cmp_file

0.02  Sat Oct 19 01:07:48 MST 1996
	- reordered some of the tests so that file not found actually
	  returns -1 like it oughta
	- wrote a test script

0.03  Sat Oct 19 03:51:04 MST 1996
	- fixed dumb bug in test script -- was using rand to change
	  a byte, which would have failed every 256 tests, y'know
	  ... using tr/// to rot it 1 char now
